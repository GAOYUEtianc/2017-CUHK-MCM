%%% Summary

\begin{summary}
  The contest rules specify that you should include a one-page summary
  of your report.  This page appears before the rest of the report,
  and will have a special header attached to it that takes up the top
  2.5" of the page.

  By typing your summary inside a \texttt{summary} environment, \TeX\ will
  handle the formatting of that page correctly, including leaving
  space at the top of the page and not numbering the page.
  
  It will also reset the page numbers so that the first page of your
  report is labeled correctly.
  
  What should you put here?  Basically, you want a brief restatement
  of the problem followed by a largely \emph{non-technical}
  description of what you've done.  Try to avoid using mathematical
  notation.
  
  You probably want to write a few paragraphs, around half to
  two-thirds of a page.

  In 2016, the COMAP folks said the following:
  \begin{quotation}
    The summary is an essential part of your MCM/ICM paper. The
    judges place considerable weight on the summary, and winning
    papers are often distinguished from other papers based on the
    quality of the summary.

    To write a good summary, imagine that a reader will choose
    whether to read the body of the paper based on your summary:
    Your concise presentation in the summary should inspire a
    reader to learn about the details of your work. Thus, a
    summary should clearly describe your approach to the problem
    and, most prominently, your most important conclusions.
    Summaries that are mere restatements of the contest problem,
    or are a cut-and-paste boilerplate from the Introduction are
    generally considered to be weak.

    Besides the summary sheet as described each paper should
    contain the following sections:

    \begin{description}
    \item[Restatement and Clarification of the Problem] State in
      your own words what you are going to do.
    \item[Explain Assumptions and Rationale/Justification]
      Emphasize the assumptions that bear on the problem. Clearly

\section{Introduction}%
\label{sec:introduction}

The authors intended to model the effect on traffic flow of the percentage of self-driving cars, the average traffic volume, and the number of lanes. In particular, interaction between vehicles are implemented by a function between the relative motion state, namely the relative distance and relative velocity of adjacent vehicles and the acceleration of specific vehicles. Then the model was applied to the data for the roads of interest. Afterwards, the authors attempted to determine an optimal strategy towards the following objectives:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Make sure of the security of this traffic system
\item Maximize the total traffic flow 
\item Avoid sharp change to velocities of vehicles to the greatest extent
\end{enumerate}
In this article, the authors decomposed the problem into the following steps when modeling and simulating:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Construct the model of traffic flow on a transportation network consisting of xxx xx and xxx.
\item Use the model to  evaluate the traffic state of given roads of interest, analyze the equilibria and tipping point, then analysis the policy changes of lanes according to the simulation result.
\item Take sensitive cases such as accidents, vibrations of acceleration of vehicles into consideration.
\end{enumerate}

  In Section~1 we give our definitions and notation. Section~2
  describes our numerical experiments\ldots{}..
  
  We prove our main result, Theorem~6, in Section~5\ldots{}.

\section{Analysis of the Problem}
\subsection{Basic model for motion}
Firstly, in order to enlarge the traffic capacity, the transportation under different percentage of self-driving cars should be analyzed.In order to simulate the transportation status, the authors gave an initial velocity to vehicles and constructed an  acceleration function. For each ordinary vehicle, its instantaneous acceleration is positively correlated to $\Delta$$v_{1}$, $\Delta$$v_{3}$, and $d_{1}$, negatively correlated to $\Delta$$v_{2}$ and $d_{2}$ since the drivers tend to accelerate if the vehicles in the front is running fast or far away, and versa for the vehicles behind, besides, if the velocity is lower than the speed limit, the vehicle tends to accelerate. To simplify the relation, we introduce a variable x ranges from -1 to 1 which is of linear relationship to  $\Delta$$v_{1}$,  $d_{1}$, $\Delta$$v_{2}$ and $d_{2}$. By assigning reasonable values to these four independent values and fitting coefficients, we got the following formula:
\begin{quotation}
 x = 0.0159(s/m)$\Delta$$v_{1}$ + 0.0010($m^{-1}$)$d_{1}$ - 0.0054(s/m)$\Delta$$v_{2}$ - 0.0004($m^{-1}$)$d_{2}$ + 0.0224(s/m)$\Delta$$v_{3}$ - 0.1000
\end{quotation}
Obviously, x is positively correlated to acceleration, however, a linear equation is not accurate enough to describe the relation, to make the motion as even as possible, we adapted "S curve". By fitting data, we got the following formula:\\
\begin{quotation}
$a_{o}$ = 3($\frac{2}{1 + e^{-4x}}$ - 1) %the unit is m/s^2
\end{quotation}
The figure of this function is as follow:\\
\begin{figure}[!htp]

\includegraphics[height=5.7cm]{Acceleration.jpg}
\caption{Acceleration}
\end{figure}
\\
As for self-driving vehicles, since they can detect others' acceleration, if the acceleration of the front vehicle changes suddenly, self-driving cars will simultaneously change its acceleration to keep consist with front vehicles.\\

\subsection{Merging and Divergence}
In reality, the number of lanes in a road is not constant, sometimes vehicles need to merge into fewer lanes and sometimes diverge to more lanes. We assumed that

\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Weakness}
\begin{enumerate}
\item We set the reaction time to be constant, but actually the reaction time of each driver at each time is fluctuant, an error may occur here.
\item We used a mathematical formula to determine the acceleration of ordinary cars, but in reality, the drivers cannot react so accurately, an uncertain error may occur.
\item In our model, the acceleration of self-driving vehicles changes sensitively, but this may cause reduction on smoothness during moving.
\item The case of overtaking is not considered in our model, if overtaking is allowed, the acceleration of vehicles will be also influenced by motion of vehicles in adjacent lanes. 
\item In the formula of acceleration, we assumed that the acceleration ranges from -3(m/$s^{2}$) to 3 (m/$s^{2}$), sharp changes on acceleration are not considered, so this model can't be applied to sensitive cases such as collision.
